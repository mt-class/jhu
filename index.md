EN 601.468/668 Machine Translation
: Fall 2023
: Tuesdays and Thursdays 1:30-2:45
: Room: Maryland 110
: [Computer Science Department](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/)
: [Johns Hopkins University](http://www.jhu.edu/)

[Google translate](http://translate.google.com/) instantly
translates between any pair of over eighty human languages
like French and English. How does it do that? Why does it
make the errors that it does? And how can you build something
better? Modern translation systems like Google Translate and
[Bing Translator](http://www.microsofttranslator.com/)
*learn* to translate by reading millions of words of already
translated text. This course will show you how they work.
We cover fundamental building blocks from linguistics,
machine learning (especially deep learning), algorithms, and data structures,
showing how they apply to a difficult
real-word artificial intelligence problem.

Textbooks
: The class follows closely two textbooks.
* [Statistical Machine Translation](http://www.statmt.org/book/) (<a href="http://statmt.org/book/errata.html">errata</a>)
by [Philipp Koehn](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/), 2010
(<a href="https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/catalog/bib_3522360">JHU library</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Statistical-Machine-Translation-Philipp-Koehn/dp/0521874157">Amazon</a>).
* [Neural Machine Translation](http://www.statmt.org/nmt-book/) (<a href="http://statmt.org/nmt-book/errata.html">errata</a>), by [Philipp Koehn](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~phi/), 2020 (<a href="https://catalyst.library.jhu.edu/catalog/bib_8609876">JHU library</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1108497322">Amazon</a>).

Grading
: To understand how machine translation works, you will build a translation system.
We will mainly grade hands-on work.

* Five homework assignments (12% each)
* Final project (30%)
* In-class presentation: Language in ten minutes (10%)

Homework Schedule
: There will be five homework assignments, tentative schedule:
* [HW1: Analysis](hw0.html), due September 7
* HW2: Word alignment, due September 20
* HW3: Decoding, due October 5
* HW4: Neural translation model part 1, due October 19
* HW5: Neural translation model part 2, due November 3

Late penalty for homework assignments: 10% per day, after 5 free "late days".
