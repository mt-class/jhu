Examining the Quality of Machine Translation
============================================

The first homework assignment does not involve any programming. Instead, you will take a closer look at the quality of todays's machine translation systems.

Translate a Web Page with Google Translate
==========================================

1. Pick a foreign language (preferable one that you have some understanding of - or an easy one like French or Spanish)
2. Find a news site that publishes news stories in that language. You can also look at Wikipedia articles, if you prefer that.
3. Pick a web page to translate and enter it with [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/)

Analyse the Translations
========================

Write a report about the quality of the machine translation.

Go over at least 20 sentences, manually correct each sentence, and report for each sentence:

1. the source sentence
2. the machine translation
3. a correction of the machine translation
4. an assessment of the error in the machine translation

You may do step 4 in any way you want. For instance, you could classify errors as "reordering errors", "word sense error for a noun", or any other type of error you can think of.

For instance:

1. _Erst drei Tage ist der neue Ministerpr√§sident Griechenlands im Amt._
2. _Only three days is the new Prime Minister of Greece in office._
3. _The new Prime Minister of Greece has been in office for only three days._
4. (1) Verb tense is wrong: _is_ instead of _has been_. (2) Preposition _for_ was missing in front of the time phrase _only three days_. (3) While the noun phrases and preprositional phrases are correct, the overall sentence structure on the clause level is scambled.

Conclude your report with a summary of your impression of the major quality problems in the machine translation system that you analysed.

What to Hand in
===============

Turn in a written report on Thursday, September 10 by noon, on Gradescope.
