Reranking <span class="text-muted">Challenge Problem 4</span>
==============================================================

In [homework 2](hw2.html) you learned to search for probable translations,
but saw that this is only useful with a good probability model. In 
[homework 3](hw3.html) you designed a metric that correlated (at least 
somewhat) with human assessments of machine translation. Armed with such 
a metric, you now have an objective way to measure a model's usefulness. In 
this assignment we will give you some sentences from Russian news articles, 
and you will use the metric to improve a model that chooses from a set of
possible English translations generated by a state-of-the-art machine
translation system. __Your challenge is to choose the best 
translations.__ 

Getting Started
---------------

Get the latest changes from the homework repo.

    git pull origin master

Or, get a fresh copy.

    git clone https://github.com/alopez/en600.468.git

Under the `reranker` directory, you have a program that chooses
a translation for each sentence from a list of candidates.

    python rerank > english.out

The reranker reads candidate translations from the file
`data/dev+test.100best`. Every candidate translation $$e\in E(f)$$ of
an input sentence $$f$$ has an associated feature vector 
$$h(e,f) = [ -\log p_{LM}(e)$$, $$-\log p_{TM}(f|e)$$, $$-\log p_{TM_{Lex}}(f|e)]$$. The
reranker takes a parameter vector $$\theta$$ whose length is equal to
that of $$h(e,f)$$. By default, $$\theta = [-1, -\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}]$$. For
each $$f$$, the reranker returns $$\hat{e}$$ according to the
following decision function.

<center>
$$\hat{e} = \arg\max_{e\in E(f)} \theta \cdot h(e,f)$$
</center>

To evaluate translations on the development set, compute BLEU
score against their reference translations.

    python compute-bleu < english.out

What's the best you could you do by picking other sentences
from the list? To give you an idea, we've given you an oracle for the
devlopment data. Using knowledge of the reference translation, it chooses
candidate sentences that maximize the BLEU score.

    python oracle | python compute-bleu

The oracle should convince you that it is possible to do _much_
better than the default reranker. Maybe you can improve it by changing
the parameter vector $$\theta$$. Do this using command-line
arguments to `rerank`. Try a few different settings. How close can
you get to the oracle BLEU score? 

The Challenge
-------------

You can improve the parameter vector by trial and error,
but that won't be very efficient. To really improve the system you need
automation. There are two components you can add: informative
features that correlate with BLEU, and effective learning algorithms that
optimize $$\theta$$ for BLEU. Your task is to improve translation quality 
on the blind test set as much as possible by improving these components.

Implementing a version of MERT or PRO along with some simple feature 
engineering will be enough to beat our baseline and earn full credit. 
However, there will still be substantial room for improvement.
Here are some ideas:

* Add a feature that counts the number of words.
* Add a feature to count words that appear to be untranslated.
* Learn new features from [this word-aligned Russian-English text](http://www.ark.cs.cmu.edu/cdyer/train.ru-en.align.gz).
* Develop a [syntactic language model](http://www.isi.edu/natural-language/projects/rewrite/mtsummit03.pdf).
* Add a [neural language model](http://aclweb.org/anthology//D/D13/D13-1140.pdf).
* Find a consensus translation using [minimum Bayes risk](http://aclweb.org/anthology//N/N04/N04-1022.pdf).

But the sky's the limit! You can try anything you want, as long as
you follow the ground rules.

Ground Rules
------------

* You can work in independently or in groups of up to three, under these 
  conditions: 
  1. You must announce the group publicly on piazza.
  1. You agree that everyone in the group will receive the same grade on the assignment. 
  1. You can add people or merge groups at any time before the assignment is
     due. **You cannot drop people from your group once you've added them.**
  We encourage collaboration, but we will not adjudicate Rashomon-style 
  stories about who did or did not contribute.
* You must turn in three things:
  1. Your translations of `dev+test.src`, selected from `dev+test.100best`.
     Upload your results to the [leaderboard submission site](http://jhumtclass.appspot.com). You 
     can upload new output as often as you like, up until the assignment deadline. 
     You will be able to see your results on test data after the deadline.
  1. Your code. Send us a URL from which we can get the code and git revision
     history (a link to a tarball will suffice, but you're free to send us a 
     github link if you don't mind making your code public). This is due at the
     deadline: when you upload your final answer, send us the code.
     You are free to extend the code we provide or roll your own in whatever
     langugage you like, but the code should be self-contained, 
     self-documenting, and easy to use. 
  1. A clear, mathematical description of your algorithm and its motivation
     written in scientific style. This needn't be long, but [it should be
     clear enough that one of your fellow students could re-implement it 
     exactly](hw-writing-exercise.html).
*  You do not need any other data than what we provide. You are
   free to use any code or software you like, __except for those
   expressly intended to generate or rerank translation output__. 
   You must write your own reranker. If you want to use machine
   learning libraries, taggers, parsers, or any other off-the-shelf resources,
   go nuts. If you aren't sure whether 
   something is permitted, ask us. If you want to do system combination, 
   join forces with your classmates.
